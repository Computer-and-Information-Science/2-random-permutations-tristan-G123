# Assignment 2 Analysis - Tristan Gannon

## Algorithm 1
5000=0.13 run time
10,000=0.54 run time
20,000=2.65 run time
40,000=8.77 run time
O(n^2)
Multiplies by 4 each time, quadrouples
## Algorithm 2
100000=0.02 run time
200000 =0.03 run time
400000 =0.08 run time
800000 =0.2 run time
1600000 = run time
3200000 =0.36 run time
6400000 =1.6 run time
O(n log n)
run time almost doubles
## Algorithm 3
500000 = 0.01 runtime
1000000 = 0.02 runtime
2000000 =0.03 runtime
4000000 =0.1 runtime
8000000 =0.18 runtime
16000000 =0.51 runtime
32000000 =1.49 runtime
O(n)
grows linearly
