# Assignment 2 Reflection - Tristan Gannon

## Approach to the Problem
First I approched it by trying to understand what the different functions did, then I went one by one down the list following the isntructions in the book


## Techniques Used
For all programs i used a for loop that went through the values in array
1: put in do loop, assigned random number and used temp to check that number, and repeated until temp returned size
2:used 'used' array to store true or false values. For loop to go through array, then assigned candadite to store a rand number in a do loop. If candadite-1 was true, the do loop would repeat
3:assigned array 0-n values 1-n+1 in order. Then repeatedly swapped values in the array with a temp variable.



## Challenges Encountered
I had multiple problems with infinate loops in alg 1 and 2. I also had a pointer issue in alg 2


## Conclusions
The main point I got out of this exercise was that efficiency is key. The different algorithms weren't more or less complex than the others, its just some were more efficient with calls, with alg 3 taking such little time because you didn't have to repeat anything on a single array.
